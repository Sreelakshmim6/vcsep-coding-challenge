# VCSEP Coding Challenge

## Overview
Using R or Python, run an analysis on the Indicies of Multiple Deprivation (IMD)
at the Local Authority District (or equivalent) level.

## Analysis
The analysis you choose to run, is up to you. It can be exploratory or
inferential. It can cover one nation or multiple nations.

## Output
How you choose to present your findings is also up to you, be it static files,
a web app, or an R/Python notebook.

## Data
Information and Data about the IMD can be found for the four devolved
nations below:
- [England IMD](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/english-indices-of-deprivation-2019)
- [Scotland IMD](https://www.gov.scot/collections/scottish-index-of-multiple-deprivation-2020/)
- [Wales IMD](https://gov.wales/welsh-index-multiple-deprivation)
- [Northern Ireland IMD](https://www.nisra.gov.uk/statistics/deprivation/northern-ireland-multiple-deprivation-measure-2017-nimdm2017)

Boundary (shapefiles), should you choose to map any output can be found below:
- [Geoportal](https://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/)
- [geographr](https://github.com/britishredcrosssociety/geographr)

## What we are looking for
- Code organisation skills
- Data wrangling and visualisation
- Coding ability will be weighted more heavily that interpretation of results
- You should spend no more than three hours on this task

## Instructions
1. Fork this repository
2. Submit a link to your forked repository, and any additional output to...

Good luck :)
