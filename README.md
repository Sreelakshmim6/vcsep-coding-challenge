# VCSEP Coding Challenge

## The challenge
Using R or Python, we would like you to run an analysis on the 2019 [English Indicies 
of Multiple Deprivation (IMD)](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/english-indices-of-deprivation-2019)
at the Local Authority District level. The analysis you choose to run is up to
you. It can be exploratory or inferential. You are expected to spend no more
than three hours on the analysis.

## The IMD
If you are unfamiliar with the IMD, a great place to start is [this](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/833959/IoD2019_Infographic.pdf) infographic. More information
and technical details can be found on the [following](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/english-indices-of-deprivation-2019)
pages.

## Data
The data you need can be found in [File 10: local authority district summaries](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/833995/File_10_-_IoD2019_Local_Authority_District_Summaries__lower-tier__.xlsx).

## Output
How you choose to present your findings is also up to you, but ideally you will
present the data in a visually compelling way, such as an R/Python notebook, a
Shiny/Plotly web app, blog post, etc.

## What we are looking for
- Code organisation skills
- Data wrangling and visualisation
- Coding ability will be weighted more heavily than interpretation of results
- You should spend no more than three hours on this task

## Submission Instructions
1. Fork this repository
2. Make sure the repository is public (Settings -> Manage access)
3. Ensure the respository contains all the data, files, and output (this could be
a link to an external site if you posted the output as a blog post, for example)
3. Submit a link to your forked repository to mattthomas@redcross.org.uk no later
than 12:00, 09.07.21.

## FAQ
1. *Who will own the code I write?*

You will. The code you write you will reside on your own forked respository.
You can choose to add a license to this code.

2. *Why the IMD?*

We use the IMD frequently alongside other data to inform out work. Being able
to analyse and understand the structure of the IMD is an important skill.



Good luck :)
